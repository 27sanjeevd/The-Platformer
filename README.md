# The-Platformer

The platformer is a Javascript canvas game that has two objectives: stay atop the platform or risk losing health, and defeat the incoming wave of aliens looking to kill you.

Tutorial:

While in game, press 'a' to move to the left, 'd' to move to the right, 'w' to jump (only have 2 jumps until you land atop a platform and regain them), and 'space' to fire your cannon. In the home screen, you will see a list of images (excluding the first one). These images show the different power-ups that can be found in game. The description of each powerup can be found beneath the image. If a powerup appears in the screen and starts flying past, you will obtain the powerup for a short period of time if you run into it. All the powerups (except for the shield) are automatically activated, and don't require user input to use. When the shield is obtained, you will need to press 'shift' to use it.

After a certain period of time, you will see red squares start appearing from the right side. These are aliens, and their goal is to kill you with their projectiles. Each alien has a certain amount of health, and it can be found above their characters. They will track your movement, and attempt to move to the same Y-coordinate as you so that they can fire their projectiles at you. 

As you progress through the game, the speed of the platforms approaching you gets increasingly faster. There is the possibility that you could get stuck behind a group of platforms, and only escape once the platforms go off the screen. One way to escape faster is to obtain the shield power-up, but you can also fire your projectiles and eliminate a platform, as they also have a certain amount of health.
